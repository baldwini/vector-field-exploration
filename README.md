# vector-field-exploration
## To run the vector_field_walk.pde, download Processing at https://processing.org/download and open the .pde file (sketch), then run it.
## The function_generator.py is not yet complete, but is close to being done, and is meant to modify the vector_field_walk.pde file to generate a new, random vector field to visualize.
